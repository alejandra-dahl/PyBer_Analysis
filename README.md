# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Pyber would like a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. They would also like to see multi-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. The main purporse is to figure out how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used for future decision making at Pyber.

## Results

This chart shows that the largest number of rides are coming from Urban areas, which also has the largest number of drivers. It is interesting to see that the average fare per ride is highest in rural areas as well as the average fare per driver.

The graph below shows the total fare by city type between January 2019 and April 2019. During this time period, Urban city types brought in the highest total fare with Rural bringing in the least. By end of April, though, Suburban total fare looks to be increasing.

## Summary
From what has been observed from this analysis, below are a few recommendations:
   
   1. Due to high fares in rural areas, PyBer doesn't seem to be the best option for Rural areas. More research is recommended in order to understand the reason behind the higher driver and rider fares - for example: distance traveled in rural areas vs urban.
   2. From the first chart, it looks like the more drivers available (especially in urban areas) the lower the average fare per ride/driver. This may be due to shorter distance traveled and proximity of things within the city. Incentives to have drivers in rural areas could be an option to drive fares down.
   3. Further reasearch after April 2019 would be helpful. Maybe suburban areas start to see more rides due to travel/tourism over the summer months. This could also change the numbers for rural and urban.
